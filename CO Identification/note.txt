The CO identification code (find_CO_peaks.m) primarily utilizes the function FastPeakFind.m developed by Dr. Adi Natan from Stanford University.

How to Run:
Download the following files: find_CO_peaks.m, FastPeakFind.m, and the example figure named Fig_example_original.png.

Copy the path of your input image file and paste it into the following line of the find_CO_peaks.m file:

I = imread("path");

For example, the line should appear as:

I = imread("D:\Dingxin\Princeton\Magic_Number\CO_identification\Fig_example_original.png");

Users may adjust the parameters in the following line of the code as needed:
p = FastPeakFind(I, 55, fspecial("disk", 5), 3, 1);
Details of these parameters are provided in the FastPeakFind.m function file.

Note that the efficiency of the code depends on the resolution of the image. The Fig_example_processed.png illustrates the procedure for calculating the number of CO molecules, the number of surface Cu atoms, and the corresponding coverage using a large-scale STM image.

If the code is executed as provided, it will identify 1003 CO molecules. However, due to the insufficient resolution of this selected image, manual correction is required to address double-counted COs and to account for missing COs. In this example, the code double-counted 77 COs and missed 17 COs.

Another important consideration is that many SPM experimental images may exhibit distortion along either the x or y direction, likely due to thermal drift. To ensure accurate counting of surface Cu atoms, experimental images were manually calibrated in the x-y dimensions.

As shown in Fig_example_process.png, the image calibration procedure is as follows:
After the CO identification process, we measure the length of known-length segments from different directions (need to be roughly perpendicular to each other) in pixels. For instance, Line1/2/3 represent distances between COs separated by 5/10/5 sites, respectively. We compute the number of pixels that represent the CO-CO sepration distance (4.4 Ã…) by calculating their total length and divide by 5/10/5, respectively. Calibration is considered successful if the calculated variance is less than ~ 0.02.

This procedure was applied to every single experimental image.
